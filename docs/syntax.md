## Markdown
Pype uses Github flavoured Markdown.


## Pypetext
In addition to regular markdown, Pype features *Pypetext* that enables you to extend the syntax.

For instance, this wiki uses this special tag for producing a Lightbox:

```
(lightbox:Console Commands source:workflow/commands_mobile.png target:workflow/commands.png)
```

Another utility tag is a clearfix tag:
```
(clearfix:)
```

Pypetext is inspired by [Kirbytext](https://getkirby.com/docs/advanced/kirbytext)
