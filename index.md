## Personal Yii Page Engine
Pype is a small, fast and versatile flat-file engine that is suitable for serving blogs, wikis and personal websites.

Pype can be run either stand-alone or as part of a larger application.

### Built with
Pype is powered by [yii2-mdpages-module](https://github.com/jacmoe/yii2-mdpages-module) which does most of the work.

The excellent Markdown parser [cebe/markdown](http://markdown.cebe.cc/) is responsible for processing the Markdown documents.

[Deployer](http://deployer.org/) is used for configuration and deployment, and [Flywheel](https://github.com/jamesmoss/flywheel) is used for temporary storage of processed documents.

And, last - but not least: Pype is built using the [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/)
